# Airship Battle
UE4 based airship battle game - based on Udemy Unreal C++ course Tank Battle game

Design a small multiplayer game in C++ / UnrealEngine as a proof of concept and as a way of making use of skills learned in Udemy tutorials.

The tutorial series is called Tank Battle. 
We propose to create a variation on this: Airship Battle.

The game will be created over a compressed timescale, with the emphasis on learning and experimentation for the developers, rather than completing a market-ready, polished final product.
